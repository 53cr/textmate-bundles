Release Notes
-------------

The package consists of a syntax highlighting file and a few handy commands:

Perl Comment Toggle (uncomments comments, comments code)
Perldoc Search
Perl Send to Affrus (requires Affrus, obviously)
Perl List subroutines
PerlTidy (requires PerlTidy from http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/, may need to tweak path)
Perl Error Report
Perl to One-liner (strips comments & extra whitespace, requires perltidy)

To Do. Fix q, qq to deal with different matched delimiters. 
	$i++ coloring. 
	/dsds/g < /asdfd/g coloring.

Done
	"last" colored as a control structure.

	Martin Vetter added [] and () to the Perl folding syntax.
	__DATA__ now highlights to the end
	q qq qw qx quoting is nicer
	Known problems: here-docs not quoted, many autoquotes not highlighted right, e.g. hashkeys in => notation.
	Noah Daniels submitted bug fix to color POD starting with ^= and not just ^=head1
	Noah Daniels also submitted bug fix for $#foo being counted as a comment.
