OnMyCommandCM (free at http://www.abracode.com/free/cmworkshop/) lets you write your own CMs using shell scripts. I just downloaded it and have quickly hacked out two contextual menu commands:

Edit in TM (pop it up on a file)
Edit New File Here in TM (pop it up on a directory; if you pick a file, it puts a new file in the same directory)

To install:
1. Download and install OMC.
2. Make sure you have the 1.1b5 tm CLI command.
3. Download OnMyCommandCMs from http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Tools/CM/
4. Import the commands using the OMC_Edit tool in the OMC folder.
5. It expects ~/bin/tm to be the binary. If yours is elsewhere, use OMC_Edit to change the paths.

There is also an alternate version of the contextual menu, by Fred B.  He reports:

The command opens a dialog asking for a name for the new file and I used "open
-a" instead of "tm" CLI command ". IMO, the advantage is that the Syntax
highlight is selected according to the extension you gave to the file name.
Plus, with the tm CLI, the file doesn't "exists" until you save it and you have
to "Saves as" to give it a proper name.

And I made it in Ruby cause I'm lazy. ;)

So, follow the Eric's recommendations to install and modify. Change the Ruby and TextMate path in OMCEdit if you have to.
